# csc545: intro to artificial intelligence

Project 1 involved using search algorithms (BFS, DFS, A*) to solve the Sliding
Tiles puzzle. See `project1/task.pdf` for project instructions. See
`project1/paper.pdf` for a writeup. `project1/data.tsv` contains the output of
over 1300 trials.

Project 2 involved using the Genetic Algorithm to maximize a fitness function.
See `project2/task.pdf` for project implementation instructions. See
`project2/paper.pdf` for the writeup. See `project2/data` for data relating
to varying population sizes and mutation rates. See `project2/src/test.js` for
more information on how the algorithm was systematically tested.

**Bonus:** The last page of the writeup contains an application of the Genetic
Algorithm to image approximation. Sample images can be found in
`project2/sample`. The implementation can be found in the
`project2/src/picture-ga/` directory

Project 3 involved building an automated reasoning system. For instructions on
running the app locally, see `project3/app/README.md`. See `project3/paper.pdf`
for the writeup.
